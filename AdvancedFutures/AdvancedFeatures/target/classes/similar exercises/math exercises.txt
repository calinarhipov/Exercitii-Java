Exercise 1: Palindrome Number
Write a Java program that checks whether a given number is a palindrome or not.
A palindrome number is the one that remains the same when its digits are reversed.
For example, 121 is a palindrome number.

Exercise 2: Armstrong Number
Write a Java program to check whether a given number is an Armstrong number or not.
An Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.
For example, 153 is an Armstrong number because 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 153.

Exercise 3: Prime Number
Write a Java program that checks whether a given number is a prime number or not.
A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

Exercise 4: Fibonacci Series
Write a Java program to generate the Fibonacci series up to a given number.
The Fibonacci series is a sequence of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.
For example, the Fibonacci series up to 10 is 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8.

Exercise 5: Factorial Calculation
Write a Java program to calculate the factorial of a given number.
The factorial of a non-negative integer n, denoted by n!, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.
For example, 5! (read as "5 factorial") is equal to 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.

The ImprovedBasket class uses AtomicInteger instead of Integer for representing the quantities of products in the basket. Here's why:

Thread Safety: AtomicInteger is designed to support atomic operations in a multi-threaded environment.
It provides thread-safe operations for incrementing, decrementing, and updating integer values without the need for explicit synchronization.

In the context of a shopping basket, it's possible that multiple threads could concurrently add or remove products from the basket.
By using AtomicInteger, the class ensures that the operations performed on the quantities are thread-safe and atomic, preventing race conditions and inconsistencies.
Mutable Integer: Unlike Integer, which is immutable (its value cannot be changed once created), AtomicInteger is mutable.
It allows modifying its value using methods like getAndAdd() or getAndDecrement().

This mutability is useful in scenarios where the quantity of a product needs to be updated or modified dynamically,
such as when adding or removing products from the basket.

Atomic Operations: AtomicInteger provides atomic operations for common operations like incrementing
(getAndIncrement() or incrementAndGet()) and decrementing (getAndDecrement() or decrementAndGet()) the value,
as well as performing atomic updates with custom functions (getAndUpdate() or updateAndGet()).

In the ImprovedBasket class, the atomic operations provided by AtomicInteger are used to increment or decrement the quantity of a product in a thread-safe manner,
without the need for additional synchronization.

By using AtomicInteger, the ImprovedBasket class ensures thread safety, allows for mutable quantities that can be modified concurrently,
and provides atomic operations for updating the quantities.

This is particularly important in scenarios where multiple threads may access or modify the basket concurrently, preventing data corruption or race conditions.
